# SubjectJ
A subject-oriented extension to the Java programming language. The aim is to implement an improved & modern Hyper/J.

Currently consists only of the underlying API. The aim is to allow the user to accomplish all the possible compositions that Hyper/J allows for. See the Hyper/J Installation & User Manual PDF for more details on Hyper/J and its semantics. This will be accomplished by first implementing the functionality in the API, then developing the syntax of the new language itself. In other words, the parser should translate the syntax into API calls.

Currently, the API implements the MergeByName, merge and override semantics of the Hyper/J specifications.
